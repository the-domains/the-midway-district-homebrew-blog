# Rejuvenating a well-loved keggle

A friendly guy named Jason who is a member of my local brew club put up a listing for a cheap, used and well-loved (his words) keggle.

It had obviously spent a lot of time over a propane burner with multiple boil-overs - there was thick black char built up all over the bottom of the keg, and the inside was encrusted with brown gook (he called it "flavour").

It also had a good deal of JB Weld epoxy built up around the weldless valve, and the top edge was sharp where the lid had been cut out.
